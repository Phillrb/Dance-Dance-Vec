Dance Dance Vec is a dance mat style game for the GCE / Milton Bradley Vectrex games console (circa 1982). 
Programmed mainly in C (with some Assembler) and developed in Xcode for Mac OSX.

This project is currently a work in progress and has not (yet) been run a real Vectrex console; be aware that a software bug on a Vectrex has the potential to cause irreverisible damage to the Vectrex screen! Please use one of the many available Vectrex emulators until this has been fully tested.
